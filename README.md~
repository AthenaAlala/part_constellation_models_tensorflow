# part_constellation_models_tensorflow

We adapt the code in github named "part_constellation_models" which is used in paper "Neural Activation Constellations: Unsupervised Part Model Discovery with Convolutional Networks" by Marcel Simon and Erik Rodner published at ICCV 2015. The original code used Caffe, and we change it to use Tensorflow.
